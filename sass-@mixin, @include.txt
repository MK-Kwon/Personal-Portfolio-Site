Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. 
They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.

Mixins are included into the current context using the @include at-rule, which is written @include <name> or @include <name>(<arguments...>),
with the name of the mixin being included.

```
@mixin reset-list {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}

@mixin horizontal-list {
  @include reset-list;

  li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: {
      left: -2px;
      right: 2em;
    }
  }
}

nav ul {
  @include horizontal-list;
}
```
