* About Vendor Prefixes

Let's answer the question: What are vendor prefixes? Simply put, vendor prefixes are a way for your browser to support new CSS features 
before they become fully supported in all browsers.

When CSS3 became popular, all sorts of new features started appearing. 
Unfortunately, not all of them were supported across all browsers. 
Vendor prefixes helped developers use those new features, and have them supported instantly without having to wait 
for each of them to become available for every browser.

Vendor prefixes are not a hack, and you should feel free to use them.

A good way to check which property is available to use without a vendor prefix is by checking the CanIUse service. 
There you can see which browser currently supports which property.



* The Prefixes
Major browsers use the following prefixes:

-webkit- Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera, almost all iOS browsers.
-moz- Firefox.
-o- Old versions of Opera.
-ms- Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.
